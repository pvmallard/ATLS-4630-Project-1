# ATLS-4630-Project-1
Project 1 for ATLS 4630, Mallory Prescott

<h2>Milestone 1</h2>
<h3>Project Proposal</h3>
<h4>Overall description of the project</h4>
The purpose of this project will be to create a functional and dynamic portfolio website draft. I want to use the <a href="https://gsap.com/about/">GSAP library</a> to make my website fun and interesting. The inspiration behind it is my current job hunting, I need a decent portfolio website, unlike those I already have, to show to employers and others to demonstrate my skills and work. I'm unhappy with all my drafts so I want to use this as an opportunity to make a site that is dynamic and creative. Even if I have to scrap the site entirely in the future, I want to use this as a draft, a practice exercise, and to utilize new libraries. The intended audience is employers and hiring managers, or anyone else that I would want to show examples of my work to. 

<h4>Wireframe</h4>
Below is a simple sketched-out wireframe depicting setups for my home page, about page, work page, etc. I would have liked to have developed a concrete wireframe in Figma, 
but I figured I could save time by just prototyping it.

<h4>Description of JS being used, how</h4>
<h4>Description of JS library used, what for</h4>
<h4>Any content/information sources</h4>
<h4>How website will be responsive for different screen sizes/environments</h4>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<h4>Prototyping</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I want to have the set up outline of each page ready to go for my first prototype. Just to have things set up for information and make sure it works well</li>
  <li>Once my outline is complete </li>
  <li>I'll likely incorporate some css as I go, particularly for the general page setup, however, this is less important to me than the library implementation, functional javascript, and HTML outline. Therefore, I will focus on the full implementation of css last</li>
</ul>

<h4>Minimum viable product</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Clean, appealing home page that utilizes multiple (at least 3-4) gsap elements to create flow and add character</li>
  <li>About me page with 1 or 2 gsap elements</li>
  <li>A few simple outline pages that might use gsap elements: work, resume, individual project page</li>
  <li>My minimum viable product will be a fluid, functional, and engaging profile home page that is accessible and easy to navigate. My portfolio should at the very least communicate the information it needs to, so it should have enough information on me and some of my projects. My home page is what I want to focus on the most but I want to have an appealing and functional version of each other type of page that I can adapt upon later: about me, work, resume, and individual project page. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Stretch goals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Have a separate database (even if its just another js or json file) to store the data and have it imported to the site</li>
  <li>Have the separate database be Firebase, learn to use and implement the library to improve my site</li>
  <li>Much later, use this as a base to recreate the portfolio in React</li>
</ul>
