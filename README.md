# ATLS-4630-Project-1
Project 1 for ATLS 4630, Mallory Prescott

<h2>Milestone 1</h2>
<h3>Project Proposal</h3>
<h4>Overall description of the project</h4>
- topic/purpose of the website
- inspiration
- intended audience
<h4>Wireframe</h4>
Below is a simple sketched-out wireframe depicting setups for my home page, about page, work page, etc. I would have liked to have developed a concrete wireframe in Figma, 
but I figured I could save time by just prototyping it.

<h4>Description of JS being used, how</h4>
<h4>Description of JS library used, what for</h4>
<h4>Any content/information sources</h4>
<h4>How website will be responsive for different screen sizes/environments</h4>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<h4>Prototyping</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I want to have the set up outline of each page ready to go for my first prototype. Just to have things set up for information and make sure it works well</li>
  <li>Once my outline is complete </li>
  <li>I'll likely incorporate some css as I go, particularly for the general page setup, however, this is less important to me than the library implementation, functional javascript, and HTML outline. Therefore, I will focus on the full implementation of css last</li>
</ul>

<h4>Minimum viable product</h4>
- Clean, appealing home page that utilizes multiple (at least 3-4) gsap elements to create flow and add character
- About me page with 1 or 2 gsap elements
- A few simple outline pages that might use gsap elements: work, resume, individual project page
- My minimum viable product will be a fluid, functional, and engaging profile home page that is accessible and easy to navigate. My portfolio should at the very least communicate the information it needs to, so it should have enough information on me and some of my projects. My home page is what I want to focus on the most but I want to have an appealing and functional version of each other type of page that I can adapt upon later: about me, work, resume, and individual project page.
