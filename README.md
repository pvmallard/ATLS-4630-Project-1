# ATLS-4630-Project-1
Project 1 for ATLS 4630, Mallory Prescott

<h2>Milestone 1</h2>
<h3>Project Proposal</h3>
<h4>Overall description of the project</h4>
The purpose of this project will be to create a functional and dynamic portfolio website draft. I want to use the <a href="https://gsap.com/about/">GSAP library</a> to make my website fun and interesting. The inspiration behind it is my current job hunting, I need a decent portfolio website, unlike those I already have, to show to employers and others to demonstrate my skills and work. I'm unhappy with all my drafts so I want to use this as an opportunity to make a site that is dynamic and creative. Even if I have to scrap the site entirely in the future, I want to use this as a draft, a practice exercise, and to utilize new libraries. The intended audience is employers and hiring managers, or anyone else that I would want to show examples of my work to. 

<h4>Wireframe</h4>

<p>
  Here is a simple sketched-out wireframe depicting setups for my home page, about page, work page, etc. I would have liked to have developed a concrete wireframe in Figma, 
  but I figured I could save time by just prototyping it. 
</p>

<h4>Details</h4>
<p>I'm going to use javascript to make elements dynamic, to implement animations, and maybe add some interesting graphs or data tools. More likely, however, I'll just be focusing on animations to make my portfolio look nice. If I have the time and ability, however, I want to try to use js to import and export data, adding it to the HTML like that rather than having it manually in the file.</p>
<p>I'll be using the GSAP library to add smooth animations to the data on the website, mostly on the home page. I'm not sure about the specific uses of them right now, however, this is just because I have yet to play around with this library and decide how I want to use it. Once I experiment with it, I'll start adding it to maybe have text slide in or add transitions. </p>
<p>Since this is just a portfolio profile website, the information I'll be using is just my past projects to supply the information. Of course, I'll still be referencing the libraries' websites for ways to implement them, troubleshooting, and combinations. I'll likely also be referencing W3C, validator.nu, and other sites to check for accessibility since I want my portfolio to use universal design principles.</p>
<p>To accommodate for different screens, I'll likely use either js or CSS to sample the user's screen size and use that information on how to set up the webpage. I'll likely end up reformating the website or display depending on if it's accessed on a mobile device or computer. Additionally, maybe I could do the same to change the colors of the page depending on whether the browser is in dark mode or not. </p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<h4>Prototyping</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I want to have the set up outline of each page ready to go for my first prototype. Just to have things set up for information and make sure it works well</li>
  <li>Once my outline is complete </li>
  <li>I'll likely incorporate some css as I go, particularly for the general page setup, however, this is less important to me than the library implementation, functional javascript, and HTML outline. Therefore, I will focus on the full implementation of css last</li>
</ul>

<h4>Minimum viable product</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Clean, appealing home page that utilizes multiple (at least 3-4) gsap elements to create flow and add character</li>
  <li>About me page with 1 or 2 gsap elements</li>
  <li>A few simple outline pages that might use gsap elements: work, resume, individual project page</li>
  <li>My minimum viable product will be a fluid, functional, and engaging profile home page that is accessible and easy to navigate. My portfolio should at the very least communicate the information it needs to, so it should have enough information on me and some of my projects. My home page is what I want to focus on the most but I want to have an appealing and functional version of each other type of page that I can adapt upon later: about me, work, resume, and individual project page. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Stretch goals</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Have a separate database (even if its just another js or json file) to store the data and have it imported to the site</li>
  <li>Have the separate database be Firebase, learn to use and implement the library to improve my site</li>
  <li>Much later, use this as a base to recreate the portfolio in React</li>
</ul>
